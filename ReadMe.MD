# Mqtt Sample

**OMG!** How do I fork Mohaqeq version of M2Mqtt? I already have the paho version, When I try fork the mohaqeq fork I'm told I've already forked it


## Why?
I'm using this repository to learn how to secure my Xamarin.Forms applications with for example a Let's Encrypt cerfificate.

## Goal
Learn best practices / real world way(s) to install and use certificates in mobile apps supported by Xamarin.Forms

## Resources
### M2Mqtt Fork
The Mqtt client. Thanks Mohaqeq
From mohaqeq on GitHub and converted to .NET Standard 2.0 library

## Gotchas
### Unlikley 
- If you configure DNS nameserver to return a hostname on a NATed ip address this code will bomb.
