# RepoDates.ConsoleApp
Calculate the number of days since a Github Repository has been created.


## Why did I write this?

I just needed some encouragment by completing a task in visual studio.
I'd been working on trying to learn how to TLS secure a XamarinForms app for 24 days.
I was getting tired, cranky, frustrated for not being able to find just the right docs to solve it myself ....
At the time of this readme creation I'm still scratching my head.

## Social Media
Now in case I want to complain, moan or wavie my hands around for perhaps a "There, there", but
probably a "RTFM bunky!" on twitter I could quickly calculate how long I've been working on this! :-)
            
This code will display create date and age of a GitHub repository.
## How to use
change these to your liking;
* string repoOwner = "jhalbrecht";                Your/any GitHub account.
* string repo = "XamarinFormsMqttSample";         Your/any Repository.
